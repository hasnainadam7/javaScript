//there are 4 ways of wrinting events in javascript

1)calling events by alert
2)by calling a functions
3)using inline events(HTML onclick="" property and element.onclick)
4)event listners(AddEvebtListner and ie 's attachevents)


//differnce betweeninline event amd AddEvebtListner
if we use the multiple times of functions with same event 
inline will override and call the last one function
AddEvebtListner will call all of them


for example
        const thirdWays = document.getElementById('thirdWay');
    
        thirdWays.onclick = ()=>{
                    alert("this is 3rd way of wrinting func")
        };

        thirdWays.onclick = ()=>{
            console.log("this is 3rd way of wrinting func")
        };


//thirdWay will show the console output

        const fourway = document.getElementById('fourthWay');
        fourway.addEventListener("click", () => {
            alert("4th type of calling functions and eventings")
        })
        const fourway = document.getElementById('fourthWay');
        fourway.addEventListener("click", () => {
            console.log("4th type of calling functions and eventings")
        })
this will show both one by one
